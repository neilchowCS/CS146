Kahn's
Add all nodes with in-degree 0 to a queue.
● While the queue is not empty:
○ Remove a node from the queue.
○ For each outgoing edge from the node, decrement the
in-degree of the destination node by 1.
○ If the in-degree of a destination node becomes 0, add it to the
queue.

DFS
Use DFS to traverse the graph and add nodes to list (stack). Return the reversed list.
Detects cycle by checking if visited node is present in a temporary set, this set being added to
as graph is traversed
Output is not layer by layer but rather going as far as possible down a current path, then doing the
same for all paths, and continuing

BFS
Kahn's algorithm is doing a BFS on the graph

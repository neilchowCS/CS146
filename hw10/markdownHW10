return null if root is null
create queue instantiated containing root

while the queue is not empty:
    store length of queue. This is the size of the current level of the tree
    instantiate temporary list. This will be the array of values of the level to be added to output.

    repeat for each node in queue (each node in current level):
        pop node from queue, store value in temporary list as output
        add children of node to queue
    after this process, queue will contain all nodes in the following level and temp array
    will contain all values of previously scanned level, which is added to output
    this is repeated for each level until none are left, resulting in the desired output of a
    level order traversal

perform a depth first search on 2d array of integers recursively

take starting cell as row, col
check if coordinates are in bounds
check if image[row][col] are not new color (to prevent infinite loop)
check if image[row][col] are the starting color of starting cell (bounds of flood fill)
these conditions end exploration of a cell

if conditions are met, swap cell color to new color
then recursively call function in the four cardinal directions

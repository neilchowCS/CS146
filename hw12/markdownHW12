to find minimum cost
create graph of houses connected by edges of weight = corresponding pipe
connect all nodes to node 0 with weight = cost of corresponding well

find MST of this graph

prim's algorithm is used

choose starting node
repeat until all nodes are connected:
select the minimum cost edge that connects a visited node to unvisited node
sets are used for speed

the cost of each selected edge is added to total cost and final value returned

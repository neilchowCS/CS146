1. insertion sort
best case O(n)
all elements in order
average/worst case O(n^2)

2. matrix multiplication
best case O(1)
matrix mismatch

average/worst case O(n^2)
2 nested for loops, with the second layer having two in parallel : O(n^2)

UPDATED solution
average/worst case O(n^3)
3 nested for loops: O(n^3)

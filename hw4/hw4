1. insertion sort
best case O(n)
all elements in order
average/worst case O(n^2)

Outer Loop: The outer loop iterates array once
Inner Loop: Compares element with each before it until the correct position for insertion is
 found. Worst case n comparisons, average n/3

2 nested loops each O(n) -> O(n^2)

2. matrix multiplication
best case O(1)
matrix mismatch

average/worst case O(n^3)
3 nested for loops: O(n^3)

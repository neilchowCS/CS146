ignore lists < len(3)
first pointer is i
iterate through list with i, skipping duplicates after first time
two other pointers, left and right. Left starts immediately to right of i, right starts at end of list
constrict left and right according to whether sum is too large or too small
when 0 sum is hit, add three sum to result list

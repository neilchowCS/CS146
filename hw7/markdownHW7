create two sorted queues, one of start times and one of end times
go through both queues, incrementing a counter when a start time is encountered and
decrementing when an end time is encountered
the desired output, minimum servers to handle tasks, is the highest value the counter reaches
this maximum is updated at the end of each unique time to get desired behavior of
[1,2][2,3] having output of 1 instead of 2

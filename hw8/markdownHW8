two slightly different but similar in concept methods used
python: created array with length = number of upper/lower letters and contents = number of
occurrences of each corresponding character
java: created hashmap that maps each letter to an integer count

after the structure with character -> number of counts is created
iterate through each character
add count//2 to length of palindrome
add 1 to length if count % 2 == 0, only once

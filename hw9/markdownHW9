by property of BST:
all children of left subtree less than root (unique BST)
therefore
if root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val
ancestor must be in left subtree

all children of right subtree > root
therefore
if root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val
ancestor must be in right subtree

if neither, p and q must be on either side of root or is root
then, root must be ancestor

through this method the lowest ancestor can be found recursively, with subsequent calls
being made on left or right subtrees

10000000000n^2 vs n^3
with asymptotic behavior as n becomes increasingly large, coefficient 10...0 becomes negligible,
n^3 > n^2 as the growth of n^3 vastly outstrips n^2 at large values of n

n^2 log(n) vs n(log(n))^10
lim(A/B) where A is n^2 log(n) and B is n(log(n))^10 as n approaches +oo is +oo.
Therefore A > B
Can also be considered dividing both sides by logn
n^2 vs nlogn^9
Then divide by n
n vs logn^9, in which case A is > B asymptotically

n^logn vs 2^sqrtn
n^logn = e^logn^2, 2^sqrtn = e^sqrtn log2
logn^2 < sqrtn log2
therefore 2^sqrtn is the greater asymtotically

2^n vs 2^2n
2^2n = 2^2^n = 4^n != 2^n
therefore 2^2n is greater
also violates big O definition

isPrime(n):
  for(i = 2, i*i <= n; i++) {
    if(n % i == 0) {
      return false
    }
  return true

best case O(1) where n is divisible by a small prime, ie 2, 3, etc
average/worst case O(sqrtn) where the for loop can iterate up to sqrt n times

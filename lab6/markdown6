when can courses be taken? when there is no cycle in prereq, false otherwise

1. convert edge list to adj list

Kahn's
Add all nodes with in-degree 0 to a queue.
● While the queue is not empty:
○ Remove a node from the queue, add to output.
○ For each outgoing edge from the node, decrement the
in-degree of the destination node by 1.
○ If the in-degree of a destination node becomes 0, add it to the
queue.

after completion, if len output != len adj list, there is a cycle

1st run floyd warshall on graph, as implemented on lecture slides
set all non existent edge lengths to higher than can be considered ie. threshold + 1

floyd warshall gives array of shortest distance to all cities for each city
for each city, count number of cities reachable within threshold
return minimum city, with later cities overriding previous minimum if tied
